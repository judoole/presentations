Wanted to learn some not-so-popular frameworks for ios-testing so I made this presentation.

Frameworks that tingled my interest:

* [OCHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest)
* [OCMockito](https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito)
* [Cedar BDD](https://github.com/pivotal/cedar)
* [Klee](http://klee.llvm.org/)
* [KIF](https://github.com/square/KIF)
* [Frank](http://testingwithfrank.com/)
* Jenkins plugins

The presentaion is written with [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

And it's in norwegian.
